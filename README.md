## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Bringing an idea to life is akin to magic and I'm pleased to say the client agreed when it came to this site. This client wanted a simple landing page for their barbershop, but had a lot they wanted to include. I was able to include all the bullet points in an elegant way while not letting the page become too busy as it was developed.

## Optimizations

An initial static image of a map was replaced by a Google Maps API providing additonal functionality, user interactivity, and a smart touch.

## Lessons Learned:

This projecy taught me more about boostrap and its various ins and outs mostly in dealing with layout. The Google API was challenging initially, but after deciding on presentation it was fairly straightforward to get the details down. This project also taught me about time management, the importance of communication with clients, and the value of over delivering.
